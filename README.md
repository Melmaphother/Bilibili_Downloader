## Ways of using
  * First, you can choose a video(cannot be the video only for VIP) in bilibili that you like ( http://bilibili.com ), then find the file 'main_GUI.exe' and open it.
  * Next, you should input the url or BV number here.
  * Finally, choose the config that you want. Then you can get a file folder named by video's BV number and all you need are included.
